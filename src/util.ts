                memory: if present, is an object containing:
                        operation: the kind of operation that triggered the exception, as a string specifying either read,  write, or execute
                        address: address that was accessed when the exception occurred, as a NativePointer
                context: object with the keys pc and sp, which are NativePointer objects specifying EIP/RIP/PC and ESP/RSP/SP, respectively, for ia32/x64/arm. Other processor-specific keys are also available, e.g. eax, rax, r0, x0, etc. You may also update register values by assigning to these keys.
                nativeContext: address of the OS and architecture-specific CPU context struct, as a NativePointer. This is only exposed as a last resort for edge-cases where context isnâ€™t providing enough details. We would however discourage using this and rather submit a pull-request to add the missing bits needed for your use-case.
